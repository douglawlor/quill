"""Source-contract test for EDS-21 RTF round-trip wiring in MainFrame.

The live MainFrame is not runtime-instantiated here; the repo validates UI wiring
through source contracts. The save path now delegates format selection to
``quill.io.export.write_document_as``, which routes ``.rtf`` targets through the
RTF io writer while other formats are converted to HTML/plain text or written
verbatim as Markdown. The open dispatch resolves ``.rtf`` via
``read_structured_document`` (which delegates to ``read_rtf_document``).
